# hello-world
I'm a kind of person who didn't give up on things i like,no matter what how difficult it is.I will put all my efforts in it to achieve my dream.
*I'm interested in graphic designing and marketing.
*My mind is a unorthodox thing that imagines a lot of things that really didn't exist and I like to convert those imaginations into visual design where the paint never get dried.
*I'm seeking for internship to expose my skills and I can assure you, I will do my best to satisfy your requirements.
